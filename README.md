3. Train models for multiple symbols
4. Perform inference and backtesting
5. Set up MLOps monitoring
6. Start the prediction API server

## 📋 Usage Guide

### Data Pipeline

Generate and process market data:

```bash
python src/data/data_collector.py  # Collect/generate data
python src/pipeline/main_pipeline.py  # Run complete pipeline
```

### Model Training

Train LSTM models for time series prediction:

```bash
python src/models/model_runner.py  # Train for all symbols
python src/models/model_runner.py --symbol AAPL  # Train for specific symbol
```

### Inference and Backtesting

Run inference with trained models:

```bash
python src/models/model_inference.py
python src/backtesting/trading_strategy.py  # Backtest trading strategies
```

### MLOps Monitoring

Set up model monitoring and drift detection:

```bash
python src/mlops/model_monitoring.py
